1. Create a first time establishment of trust between pc and thintoken
    a. could be a basic handshake, where a random string will be generated
    b. then that string will be stored in both the pc and a secure location in the espfs
    c. ESP32 BLE stop advertising
    d. all future characteristic reads will require validation of this key

LIMITATIONS of 1:
    a. only 1 pair at a time, to transfer devices, the esp must forget the current key and repeat the handshake

2. In browser, write keys in storage (see browser extensions Storage API)

3. Flow:
    a. User taps RFID tag
    b. ESP32 generates TOTP and saves it in memory temporarily
    c. Notify clients (theoretically this should only be one) that a tag is tapped
    d. The true client must write to a characteristic its key
    e. ESP validates key
    f. If key is valid, update a characteristic to reflect TOTP
    g. PC reads the characteristic with the TOTP
    h. PC writes acknowledgement(?)
    i. After TOTP gets read, clear the characteristic
